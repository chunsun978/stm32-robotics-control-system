Quick pin test instructions:

If PA5 doesn't show on scope, try testing a different GPIO pin:

Option 1: Use PA6 (available on CN10 pin 13)
Option 2: Use PA7 (available on CN10 pin 15)

These pins need to be configured first in STM32CubeMX, but PA5 (LD2) is already configured and should work.

Make sure:
1. Scope probe ground clip is connected to board GND
2. Scope is on DC coupling (not AC)
3. Time base is slow enough (500ms/div or 1s/div)
4. Voltage scale shows 0-5V range
5. You're probing the correct physical pin
